# TechFlow Solutions: DevSecOps Learning Project

## Learning Journey Overview
This project is a hands-on DevSecOps learning journey, following a structured curriculum to build real-world, job-ready skills. Each phase is documented for practical reference and portfolio use.

### Progress So Far
- **Week 1:** Linux Mastery (file systems, permissions, scripting)
- **Week 2:** Git & Networking Deep Dive ([see networking_practice.md](./networking_practice.md))
- **Week 3:** Docker Essentials (containerization, Compose)
- **Week 4:** Cloud Basics (Azure VMs, Blob Storage, Azure AD, VNet, static site) — [see azure_cloud_basics.md](./azure_cloud_basics.md)

## How to Follow Along
- Each week’s practical steps and reflections are documented in the `docs/` folder.
- Start with the [DevSecOps Learning Plan](./devsecops_learning_plan.md) for the full curriculum.
- For networking labs, see [networking_practice.md](./networking_practice.md).
- For Azure cloud hands-on, see [azure_cloud_basics.md](./azure_cloud_basics.md).
- For AWS cloud hands-on (optional), see [aws_cloud_basics.md](./aws_cloud_basics.md).

## Next Steps
- Continue with the Azure Cloud Basics practicals.
- Update the frontend to showcase your learning progress (see below).

## Showcasing Progress in the App
